# Procurement Foundations

The cloud can be bought in different ways:

1. Direct (AWS) aka you do the work to build
2. Indirect (CSP Partner/Reseller) who do the work for you (for a price)

Selling a single model -> the contract of a Cloud service is one-to-many so the buyer is responsible either building the services in cloud or find a AWS Partner Network (APN) to do the job
